This repo was created as a follow-through-code for "[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)" written by Thorsten Ball. It's a great book for insights about writing an interpreter. Follow the link for more details about the book.

This repo was initialized using template from [`node-typescript-boilerplate`](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate). The template was provided under Apache-2.0 license and this repo is also available under same license. As far as my understanding goes its similar to MIT license. If there is anything wrong, let me know and I will try to correct it. I have kept the sponsor link for the original author, please sponsor if you can.

## Motivation

Ever since I got into programming compilers/interpretors always seemed like magic to me. I always wanted to understand how compilers work under the hood. [This tweet](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1557347948022964225?s=20&t=3qdrVXXQ7iqW8kFCUAOtaQ) by [@ThePrimeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen) introduced me to the book and hence I created this repo.

## How to use it?

Currently this repo is in very early phase, we have a minimal working REPL that prints all the valid tokens. To run it, install all the dependencies and then do `yarn build && yarn start`.
